in ns_access.c, there is a LIMIT to the hash table size related to the access Control
data structure. "INITIAL_TABLE_SIZE". also, we only allow 50% of INITIAL_TABLE_SIZE as the actual
number of users in the system -> "LOWER LOAD FACTOR" 

Lower Load Factor (e.g., 50%)
✅ Fewer collisions - Less likely that multiple keys hash to the same bucket
✅ Faster lookups - O(1) average case stays closer to O(1)
✅ Shorter chains - When collisions occur, the linked lists are shorter
❌ More memory - Wastes 50% of allocated space

Higher Load Factor (e.g., 90%)
✅ Better memory utilization - Uses most of the allocated space
❌ More collisions - Many keys hash to same bucket
❌ Slower lookups - O(1) degrades toward O(n) as chains grow
❌ Longer chains - More nodes to traverse in linked lists

Issues found:

- "READ"ing a file does not update its "Last Access" time in both VIEW -l & INFO
- "Size" not updating in "VIEW -l" & INFO
- have to add sentence count & character count in "VIEW -l" & "INFO"
